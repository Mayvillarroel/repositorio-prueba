# Copilot Instructions for `repositorio-prueba`

## Project Overview
This repository is a simple Python project with two main source files: `codigo.py` and `codigo2.py`. The project currently contains minimal documentation and no explicit build, test, or dependency management files.

## Architecture & Patterns
- All code is located at the root level, with no submodules or package structure.
- There are no external dependencies or requirements files (e.g., `requirements.txt`).
- No test framework or test files are present.
- The codebase is suitable for small scripts or prototyping.

## Developer Workflows
- **Run scripts:** Execute Python files directly using `python codigo.py` or `python codigo2.py`.
- **No build step:** There is no compilation or build process required.
- **No automated tests:** Manual testing is expected; add tests if needed.

## Conventions
- Code is written in Spanish (see README and file names).
- No enforced code style, linting, or formatting tools.
- No custom project-specific patterns detected.

## Integration Points
- No external APIs, services, or integrations are present.
- No environment variables or configuration files are used.

## Recommendations for AI Agents
- Focus on clear, readable Python code in `codigo.py` and `codigo2.py`.
- If adding new features, consider creating a `requirements.txt` for dependencies and a `tests/` folder for test scripts.
- Document any new conventions or workflows in the README.
- If introducing complexity, refactor into modules or packages as needed.

## Example Usage
```powershell
python codigo.py
python codigo2.py
```

## Key Files
- `codigo.py`: Main Python script
- `codigo2.py`: Secondary Python script
